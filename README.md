  ## About

  This project has no purpose other than to get me back into coding.
  I fell in love with C++ in 2004 and made a living out of it between 2007-2010. I hadn't used it ever since.
  So, here goes, a task manager CLI because why not.

  And if I ever want to go crazy with this, I could store state in a JSON file or, god forbid, write tests.
